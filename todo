Death and done checks are performed in the wrong place
Death and done checks are inside the philosopher threads rather than being monitored by a separate monitoring thread
The is_dead and is_done functions are called after the main while loop, so they may never execute


Race condition in death checking
The t_last_eat value is updated without proper mutex protection
Multiple threads could be checking/updating death status simultaneously


Potential deadlock in fork acquisition
Even with the odd/even approach to acquiring forks, there's insufficient deadlock prevention
No timeout for fork acquisition attempts


Loop termination condition issues
Philosophers check philo->arg->done != 1 but there's no way for them to see this value change while they're in eating/sleeping cycles
The main thread doesn't continuously monitor for end conditions


Incorrect mutex handling
Only one fork mutex is initialized, but then you try to use an array of them
There's a commented out mutex lock //pthread_mutex_lock(&arg->print); in the cleanup function


Synchronization problems
The is_dead and is_done functions don't properly protect shared data access
